## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:atlonglastkibet/AcademIQ.git
````

### 2. Navigate into Your Team Folder

Work from your respective folder in the project directory.

### 3. Create a New Branch

Always work on a new branch instead of `main` (or `master`).

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/backend-api
```

### 4. Make Changes

Add or modify code in your section (e.g., `backend/`, `frontend/`, `database/`, etc.).
When ready, check what changed:

```bash
git status
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added new backend routes for user authentication"
```

### 6. Pull the Latest Changes

Before pushing, always pull the latest version from `main` to avoid conflicts:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

If there are merge conflicts, resolve them locally before pushing.

### 7. Push to Remote

Once your branch is ready:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 8. Open a Pull Request (PR)

On GitHub:

* Go to your repository page.
* Click **Compare & Pull Request**.
* Add a clear title and description.
* Assign reviewers or tag teammates.

### 9. Merge After Review

After approval, your PR can be merged into `main`.
Then, everyone can update their local copy:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

```
